# **About Me**

I am a data scientist, tech economist, and science leader. I am currently leading the pricing science teams at [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/), Europe's biggest e-commerce company. 

Previously, I did a stint in public policy, as Director of AI & Data at the German Ministry of Health's [in-house think tank](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Innovation_Hub). And I led data science teams at [QuantCo](https://www.quantco.com/), a German-American startup specializing in causal inference and machine learning. My work spanned from e-commerce to health insurers, and much of it focused on parsing out causal signal from observational data.

I hold a masters in data science from Stanford University, and two bachelor degrees in economics and philosophy from Heidelberg University.

All views expressed are my own, and are not necessarily representative of my employers or the German Government.
