# **About Me**

I am a data scientist, tech economist, and science leader. I am currently a Senior Principal Data Scientist in [Microsoft's](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mschwarz/) Office of the Chief Economist.

Previously, I led pricing science teams at [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/), Europe's biggest e-commerce company. I did a stint in public policy, as Director of AI & Data at the German Ministry of Health's [in-house think tank](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Innovation_Hub). And I led data science teams at [QuantCo](https://www.quantco.com/), a startup specializing in causal inference and machine learning.

I hold a masters in data science from Stanford University, and two bachelor degrees in economics and philosophy from Heidelberg University.

All views expressed are my own, and are not necessarily representative of my employers.
