description: "As an invited expert, I co-authored a discussion paper by Germany's National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. The group of authors unites an impressive interdisciplinary expertise, allowing for a holistic view of digital opportunities in COVID-19-response. Particularly exciting for me personally: all available evidence suggests a positive, if moderate, effect of Germanyâ€™s Corona-Warn-App."
