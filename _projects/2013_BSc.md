description: My BSc thesis in economics explored a surprising discovery in iterated 2x2 games. I showed that extortion is feasible in more games than just Prisoner's Dilemma, and simulated convergence behavior. I am proud that as an early and accessible exploration of the topic, my paper was cited by several researchers.
