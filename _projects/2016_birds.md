description: We train a reinforcement learner to play the game Angry Birds. We show that the efficiency of regular Îµ-greedy Q-Learning can be improved through more systematic exploration in Randomized Least Squares Value Iteration (RLSVI), an algorithm that samples its policy from a posterior distribution on optimal policies.
